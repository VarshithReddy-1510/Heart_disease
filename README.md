Heart disease is a significant public health concern worldwide, contributing to millions of deaths annually. As a student, selecting heart disease prediction as a project topic for an assignment provides an opportunity to delve into a critical area of healthcare and contribute to the advancement of predictive analytics in medicine.

Heart disease encompasses various conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and congenital heart defects. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease risk factors are crucial for implementing preventive measures and improving patient outcomes.

The project will also explore the ethical implications of using predictive analytics in healthcare, including issues related to data privacy, algorithm transparency, and equitable access to healthcare services. By addressing these concerns, the project aims to develop a robust and ethically responsible predictive model for heart disease prediction.
